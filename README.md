iPhotoDump
=======

Perl script that will dump/backup iPhoto/Aperture metadata

This is helpful if you wish to leverage additional scripts to upload your
files to 3rd party services (i.e flickr - http://www.panix.com/~eli/flickr/), 
or simply backup your metadata. 


Configuration 
-------------
Make sure you change the location of your iPhoto/Aperture database to reflect where it really is.  This will probably be "/Users/<you>/Pictures/iPhoto Library/Database/"
